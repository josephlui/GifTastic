# GifTastic

GifTastic provides animated gifs for cartoon stories.  The animated gifs are provided by GIPHY API.  The gifs are pulled from the API in real time as the client clicks on the cartoon topics.  You can simply start by searching the animated gifs by clicking on any of the existing cartoon story.  If the cartoon story you are interested in is missing from the list, you can add the cartoon to the list of cartoon topics and start getting animated gifs for it.
